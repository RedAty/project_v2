# Project V2
This is a learning project to create a 3D (*later WebXR Experience*) in Babylon JS 5, using webpack and es6 modules.

It contains code and assets, so you can clone, *learn* and do modifications.

## Getting Started

### Build and Test
1. Clone the project or download in a .zip
2. In the root folder execute `npm install`
3. To run the live Dev Build: `npm run webpage_serve`
   1. To create build: `npm run create_dist`

### Requirements

Node JS, and NPM is required for this repository. The recommended NPM version is 8 (*currently installed: 8.3.1*), whereas the recommended Node version is 16 and up. (*currently installed 16.14.0*)

If you don't have node already, install node from here: <https://nodejs.org/en/download/> or use nvm (explained later) to control which version is currently installed.

To check your npm and node version after node was installed:

```shell
node --version
npm --version
```

### Recommendations

If you are using Jetbrains WebStorm as IDE, it can manage all needed extensions automatically, like ESLint.
In VSCode you might need to install some extensions to access all development features.
